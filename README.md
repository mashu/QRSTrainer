# Morse Code Trainer

A comprehensive Android application for learning Morse code using the Koch method training approach.

## Features

### üéØ Koch Method Training
- Progressive character introduction following the standard Koch sequence
- Starts with K and M, gradually adds new characters
- Adaptive progression based on user performance
- 41 characters total including letters, numbers, and common punctuation

### üéµ Audio Generation
- Real-time Morse code audio synthesis
- Customizable WPM (Words Per Minute) speed (5-50 WPM)
- Farnsworth timing for character spacing
- Configurable repeat count (1-5 times)
- High-quality sine wave generation at 600Hz

### üìä Progress Tracking
- Individual character statistics (correct/incorrect counts)
- Overall accuracy tracking
- Session-based progress monitoring
- Adaptive weighting system that emphasizes problematic characters
- Visual progress indicators with color coding

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Settings
- **Speed Control**: 5-50 WPM
- **Level Management**: Manual level selection or automatic progression
- **Group Size**: Configurable minimum (1-10) and maximum (1-15) character groups
- **Timing**: Answer timeout (3-30 seconds)
- **Progression**: Required correct answers to advance (1-50)
- **Level Locking**: Option to stay at current level for focused practice

### üìà Statistics & Analytics
- Character-specific accuracy rates
- Attempts counter per character
- Visual progress bars
- Streak tracking
- Weighted character selection based on performance

## How to Use

1. **Start Training**: Open the app and navigate to the "Trainer" section
2. **Listen**: Audio plays automatically with the configured repeat count
3. **Input**: Use the on-screen keyboard to enter the characters you heard
4. **Progress**: Correct answers advance your progress toward the next level
5. **Review**: Check the "Progress" section to see detailed statistics
6. **Configure**: Adjust settings in the "Settings" section to customize your experience

## Koch Method Sequence

The app follows the standard Koch method character sequence:

```
K M U R E S N A P T L W I . J Z = F O Y , V G 5 / Q 9 2 H 3 8 B ? 4 7 C 1 D 6 0 X
```

## Training Philosophy

The Koch method is proven effective because it:
- Maintains consistent high-speed character transmission
- Uses Farnsworth timing for comfortable character spacing
- Gradually increases character set complexity
- Adapts to individual learning patterns through weighted selection

## Technical Details

- **Minimum Android Version**: API 31 (Android 12)
- **Target SDK**: 35
- **Audio**: Pure sine wave synthesis using AudioTrack
- **Data Persistence**: SharedPreferences with JSON serialization
- **Architecture**: MVVM with data binding
- **UI**: Material Design components with CardView and RecyclerView
